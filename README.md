# 555 Timer Circuit

This project demonstrates the functionality of the **555 Timer IC**, which is widely used for generating clock pulses, delays, and timing applications. The **555 Timer** can be configured in **astable**, **monostable**, or **bistable** modes, making it versatile for various applications.

## Project Structure

- **Graph.png**: Graphical representation of the simulation results .
- **Schematic.png**: Schematic diagram of the 555 timer circuit.
- **555_Timer.asc**: LTSpice simulation file for the 555 timer circuit.

## Features

- **Monostable Mode**: Generates a single pulse output for a given time duration after a trigger input.
- **Astable Mode**: Operates as a clock pulse generator with continuous high/low output.
- **Bistable Mode**: Functions as a flip-flop or memory element, retaining its state until changed by inputs.

## Requirements

- **LTSpice software**: A powerful simulation tool for analog circuits. You can download it from [LTSpice download page](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html).
- **Basic understanding of 555 Timer circuits and timing applications**.

## Usage

1. **Install LTSpice**:
   - **Download and install LTSpice** from the official website.
   
2. **Open the Simulation File**:
   - **Open the `555_Timer.asc` file in LTSpice**. This file contains the full simulation setup for both the modulation and demodulation circuits.
   
3. **Run the Simulation**:
   - Once the file is open in LTSpice, **click the Run button** to start the simulation.

4. **View Results**:
   - Check the graphical output in **Graph.png** to see the simulation results.
